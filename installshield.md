# InstallShield

## Preface
When you want to copy your software into another machine, you need to perform a few routine tasks. These may include:

- Registering `.dll` files  
- Checking for existing versions  
- Asking for user input  
- Setting expiry dates for evaluation copies  
- Restricting installations to a given number of licenses  

To achieve this in the Windows environment, there are a few software options. One is the InstallShield setup that comes with Visual Basic, and another is the professional InstallShield software from [InstallShield.com](http://www.installshield.com).  

Among them, **InstallShield Professional** is the most user-friendly. Avoid relying entirely on AppWizardâ€”hand coding is better. Always test the setup on a **bare machine**.
